# flepimop_influenza_BE

A repisitory containing an age-stratified influenza model, simulated either spatially-explicit or non-spatially-explicit for Belgium. Uses the [in-house code of the JHU IDD group](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/flepiMoP) to simulate and calibrate the model.

## Goals

- Learn how to build models with FlepiMoP
- Benchmark computational complexity and user-friendliness against [my influenza demo model](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2023.102148) implemented using [pySODM](https://twallema.github.io/pySODM).
- Calibrate the models to data from the 2017-2018 Influenza season in Belgium. Once more assess its computational complexity and user-friendliness.
